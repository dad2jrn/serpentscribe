2. Clone your fork to your local machine.
3. Create a new branch for your changes.
4. Make your changes.

Enhance logging functionality and update packageâ€¦

DESCRIPTION

This commit extends the functionality of the SerpentScribe decorator to include flexible configuration of log level, optional logging to a specified file path, and expanded documentation on usage. Detailed descriptions for each supported log level have been added to the README.

This also modifies the project's version number in setup.py from '0.1' to '0.2' and refines the package's short description text.

Notable changes:
- The decorator now requires a log level ("DEBUG", "INFO", "WARNING", "ERROR", "CRITICAL").
- File logging can be optionally enabled by providing a file path.
- Each function invocation will continue to output logs to stdout.
- Readme has been enriched with explanatory information about features and usage.
```

- **Testing**: Add any new tests necessary to cover the changes made.
